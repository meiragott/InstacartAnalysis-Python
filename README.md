# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis Project [Python]
Data-driven analysis using Python for the real company Instacart to uncover sales patterns, inform marketing strategies, and improve customer segmentation.

---

## Introduction
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app, wants to gain deeper insights into its sales patterns to enhance its marketing strategies. As an analyst, my task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of their data to derive actionable insights and suggest strategies for better customer segmentation.

### Disclaimer
***Instacart is a real company that’s made its data available online. However, the contents of this project brief have been fabricated for this project.***

## Objective
The objective of this project is to use Python to perform data analysis on Instacart's sales data. The aim is to uncover patterns and trends in customer behavior to inform targeted marketing strategies. The analysis will focus on identifying busy periods, spending habits, popular product categories, and customer segmentation based on various demographic factors.

## Context
The Instacart stakeholders are interested in understanding the diversity of their customer base and their purchasing behaviors. They assume that a one-size-fits-all marketing approach is not effective and are considering a targeted marketing strategy. The analysis will help to determine the right customer profiles to target with specific marketing campaigns, ensuring relevance and effectiveness in driving sales.

## Key Questions
The Instacart stakeholders have several key questions to guide their marketing and sales strategies:
1. What are the busiest days and hours for orders?
2. When do customers spend the most money?
3. How can products be grouped by price ranges to direct marketing efforts?
4. Which product categories are the most popular?
5. How do customer demographics and behaviors vary, including brand loyalty, regional differences, and order habits by age and family status?

## Stakeholders
- **Vice President of Marketing**: “We’re always looking into improving our targeting for ad campaigns.”
- **Senior Vice President of Sales**: “We need to know what part of our offering has the lowest market share and why. Based on this input, we could improve this sector and boost sales.”
- **Instacart Customer**: “I want to receive ads, promotions, and recommendations that are relevant to the products I order regularly.”

## Data & Tools
### Data Sources
The data used is open-source data sets from Instacart along with a customer data set created for this project. These data sets include various identifiers that allow for comprehensive analysis and merging.
- **Customers Data Set**: Contains customer demographic and behavior information.
- **Instacart Data Sets**: Includes order, product, and transaction data.

### Tools
- **Python**: Used as the primary language for data analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: An interactive computing environment for developing and presenting data analyses.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Anaconda**: For managing the Python environment and libraries.
- **Excel**: For additional data analysis and visualization, as well as the final report.

## Visualizations
To effectively communicate the results of the analysis, I created various visualizations  (***View the final report in the repository folder `05 Sent to Client` in the file `Instacart-final_report_MGottlieb.xlsx`.***):
- **Order Frequency by Day and Hour**
- **Spending Patterns by Time of Day**
- **Customer Segmentation by Customer Profile Variable: Age Group, Dependents, and Income**
- **Customer Profiles Across Regions and Geographic Areas**
- **Customer Behavior by Customer Profile with Average Days Since Prior Order**
- **Top Five Departments by Region and Customer Profile**
- **Average Spending by Customer Profile Across Regions**
- **Top Five Products by Region and Customer Profile**

These visualizations will help Instacart stakeholders understand the data insights at a glance and make informed decisions for their marketing and sales strategies.

## Folders
- **01 Project Management:** Project brief
- **02 Data:** Separated into two subfolders Original Data. These contain the original data frames and Prepared Data contains the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis. (*Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size limitations.*)
- **03 Scripts:** Jupyter notebooks containing coding for the analysis.
- **04 Analysis:** The Visualizations subfolder contains the visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- **05 Sent to Client:** The final report is presented in an Excel document.


## Resources
- **Instacart Data Dictionary**: Documentation of data set variables and structure.
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Anaconda**: For managing Python environment and dependencies.
